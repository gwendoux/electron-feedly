Electron-Feedly
---------------

This is just a demo. Use at your own risk.

I just want to run Feedly in a dedicate window, open links in my default browser window in background and display unread items with a specific icon.

## Todo

- [X] Use specific icon
- [X] Display badge
- [X] Open external links in default browser
- [ ] Open links in background
- [ ] Display unread items
